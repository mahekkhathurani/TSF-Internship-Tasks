# TSF-Internship-Tasks
## Task-1:
Linear Regression with Python Scikit Learn (Supervised ML)
- In this regression task, I have predicted the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied. This is a simple linear         regression task as it involves just two variables.

## Task-2:
Prediction using Unsupervised ML (K-Means Clustering)
- Predicted the optimum number of clusters from the given ‘Iris’ dataset, and represented it visually.
